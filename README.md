# Carnival Ring Toss Game through Greedy Programming using Java
I implemented a greedy algorithm to solve the Carnival Ring Toss Challenge in Java, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n). The objective was to determine the minimum number of ring tosses required to match a given set of target heights for pegs, where each toss could affect a contiguous group of pegs.
For the input array [2,3,4,2,1], the goal is to match the target peg heights using the minimum number of ring tosses. Andy first tosses rings on the first three pegs twice, incrementing them to [2, 2, 2, 0, 0]. Then, he tosses rings on the last four pegs, adjusting them to [2, 3, 3, 1, 1]. Finally, he tosses rings on the third and fourth pegs, reaching the target [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]. This optimal solution requires four tosses while efficiently distributing rings to match the desired peg heights.
The algorithm efficiently analyzed the peg heights and determined the best possible tosses to minimize the total number of moves while ensuring that all pegs reached their exact target values.
By leveraging greedy principles, I ensured that the algorithm made the most optimal local decision at each step, leading to a globally efficient solution. The solution was thoroughly tested against multiple test cases to verify correctness and performance. Throughout the development process, I followed best coding practices in Java.
